## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Analyzing Effect of Selected Macroeconomic Indicators on Housing Affordability in USA.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
A case study of top 10 Metroplitans of USA: How macro-economic indicators (Inflation, Interest Rates, and Income) has effected the housing affordability over last 10 years.

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
As a student living in Germany, and having experienced overal invrease in inflation and the housing crisis in metropolitan areas shows how much importance the Housing Sector have in an Economy because house rentals take a large chunk out of our disposable incomes so if rents are high it means one would be left with less money to spend, and this effect gets amplified with with rising inflation as the money loses its value over time. This project would be very insightful for the people who want to leave Germany due to language barriers or other preferences and move to USA (a dream destination for many) as this study attempts to help these people make informed choices based on statistcs. This study would use some macro-economic inicators as a rough measure of economic stability in USA and would also show how bad/good the Housing market is performing in recent years because it also entails how hard/easy is it to start a new life in USA.

Analysis Steps:
1. Analyzing CPI with single home prices and all homes prices.
2. Analyzing CPI with single home rent prices and all home rent prices.
3. Analyzing 30-year-fixed mortgage rates with the demand of single family and all homes combined.
4. Analyzing real-median-household growth income with CPI, home prices, and home rental prices.
5. Analyzing real-disposable-personal-income growth income with CPI, home prices, and home rental prices.
6. (Tentative) Analyzing the effect of unemployment rate on house affordability.

#### Short description of the DataSource:
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED) USA, is a database of more than 800,000 economic data series from over 100 sources covering issues and information relating to banking, business, consumer and producer price indices, employment, population, exchange rates, gross domestic product, interest rates, trade and international transactions, and U.S. financial data. In general, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis encourages the use of FRED data, and associated materials, to support policymakers, researchers, journalists, teachers, students, businesses, and the general public. FRED provides data and data services to the public for non-commercial, educational, and personal uses subject to a few prohibitions.
All the macro-economic data is sourced from official website of Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED), USA. FRED collects data from different government departments e.g., U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) etc and then adds some value to these data sources to make them analysis ready. For example,  BLS provides most of the CPI data in chunks and FRED compiles all the data into a timeseries data with some value additions like smoothing the data for seasoanlity etc. Although, we have downloaded everyhting from FRED but the original departmental sources of different indicators are give below.

#### Short description of the DataSource:
The Zillow Economic Research team publishes a variety of real estate metrics including median home values and rents, inventory, sale prices and volumes, negative equity, home value forecasts and many more. Most datasets are available at the neighborhood, ZIP code, city, county, metro, state and national levels, and many include data as far back as the late 1990s. All data accessed and downloaded from this page is free for public use by consumers, media, analysts, academics and policymakers. Proper and clear attribution of all data to Zillow is required.

#### We will use three different datasets built using a different index, each index is for a different purpose as described below.
1. Home Prices: Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI): A measure of the typical home value and market changes across a given region and housing type. It reflects the typical value for homes in the 35th to 65th percentile range.
2. Home Rental Prices: Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI): A smoothed measure of the typical observed market rate rent across a given region. ZORI is a repeat-rent index that is weighted to the rental housing stock to ensure representativeness across the entire market, not just those homes currently listed for-rent. The index is dollar-denominated by computing the mean of listed rents that fall into the 35th to 65th percentile range for all homes and apartments in a given region, which is weighted to reflect the rental housing stock.
3. Rental Home Demand: Zillow Observed Renter Demand Index (ZORDI): A measure of the typical observed rental market engagement across a region. ZORDI tracks engagement on Zillowâ€™s rental listings to proxy changes in rental demand. The metric is smoothed to remove volatility.
